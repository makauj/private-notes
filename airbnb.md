# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

## Background Context
The AirBnB clone project is a full stack project that will take 4 months to complete. The goal is to to deploy on my server a so=imple copy of the AirBnB wesite.
We will implement features one after another, covering all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming stack.
The complete website will be composed of:
1. A console interpreter. The console interpreter will manipulate data without a visual interface, like a shell.
2. The front-end. This will be the website that can be used by everyone.
3. A database to store data(Objects)
4. An API to connect the back-end to the front-end.

## COnceptes I need to learn
- Unittest
- Python packages
- `*args` and `**kwargs`
- `datetime`

## The Console
The console is a command line interpreter. It will help us play around with the data without the need of a developed website.
Completing the console lets us test out new ideas, tweak things and fix any issues smoothly.
It also helps us visualize how the whole project will fit together.
