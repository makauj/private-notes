# Python Classes

## Introductions
An object-oriented program carries the basic idea that both data and methods combine into a single unit, called and object, which operates on the data.
Almost everything in Python, being an object-oriented language, is an object. For example, strings, lists are objects defined by the string and list classes which are available by default into Python.

In the example below, we declare two variables, 'string1' and 'number_list', and test their type with type() function.
```python
>>>string1 = "Hello, World!"
>>>type(string1)
<class 'str'>
>>>number_list = [1, 3, 7, 15, 123. -430]
>>>type(number_list)
<class 'list'>
```
The example above gives the output `<class 'str'>` and `<class 'list'>`
