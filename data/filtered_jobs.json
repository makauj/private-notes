Just as servers work together to scale compute in web2, so too can rollups scale onchain compute in web3. But building and operating your own rollup is difficult and time-consuming. That's where Conduit comes in.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">As the rollup-native cloud platform, Conduit combines web2 engineering best-practices with web3 rollup technology to make it easy for anyone to launch and maintain their own chain. By making infrastructure simple and onchain compute abundant, similar to how AWS and GCP did for web2, we can unlock the next wave of innovation in the crypto ecosystem.</p><p style=\"min-height:1.5em\">The Conduit platform has seen massive growth since going live in 2023. We <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://rollup.wtf/\">run the largest chains</a> in production, including Proof of Play, Zora, Aevo, and <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" href=\"https://www.conduit.xyz/customers\">more</a>. This translates to 200+ chains across mainnet and testnet and over $1B in total-value-locked (TVL).
