Our cohort-based model means our engagement rates are 80-90% instead of the 5-10% from video-based learning. Maven's marketplace has 500+ expert-led cohort-based courses, 70K+ student alumni, and 700K+ registered users.

The operating system for folks who build software.</p><p>We started with open-source product analytics, <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/story\"><u>launched out of Y Combinator's W20 cohort</u></a>. We've since shipped <a href=\"https://posthog.com/products\"><u>more than a dozen products</u></a>, including:</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://posthog.com/docs/data-warehouse\"><u>A built-in data warehouse</u></a>, so users can query product and customer data together using custom SQL insights.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://posthog.com/docs/cdp\"><u>A customer data platform</u></a>, so they can send their data wherever they need with ease.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://posthog.com/ai\"><u>PostHog AI</u></a>, an AI-powered analyst that answers product questions, helps users find useful session recordings, and writes custom SQL queries.</p></li></ul><p>Next on the roadmap are CRM, messaging, revenue analytics, and support products. When we say every product that companies need to run their business, we really mean it!</p><p>We are:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Product-led</strong>. More than 100,000 companies have installed PostHog, mostly driven by word-of-mouth. We have intensely strong product-market fit.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/aord.html\"><strong><u>Default alive</u></strong></a>. Revenue is growing 10% MoM on average, and we're very efficient. We raise money to push ambition and grow faster, not to keep the lights on.</p></li><li><p><strong>Well-funded.</strong> We've raised more than $100m from some of the world's top <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/strategy/investors\"><u>investors</u></a>. We're set up for a long, ambitious journey.</p></li></ol><p>We're focused on building an awesome product for end users, hiring exceptional teammates, shipping fast, and <a href=\"https://posthog.com/deskhog\"><u>being as weird as possible</u></a>.</p><p><br /></p><h2>Things we care about</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Transparency:</strong> Everyone can read about our roadmap, how we pay (or even let go of) people, our strategy, and how we work, in our <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook\"><u>public company handbook</u></a>. Internally, we share revenue, notes and slides from board meetings, and fundraising plans, so everyone has the context they need to make good decisions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Autonomy:</strong> We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell anyone what to do. Everyone chooses what to work on next based on what's going to have the biggest impact on our customers, and what they find interesting and motivating to work on. <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/wide-company\"><u>Engineers lead product teams</u></a> and <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/which-products\"><u>make product decisions</u></a>. Teams are flexible and easy to change when needed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shipping fast:</strong> <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/values#why-not-now\"><u>Why not now?</u></a> We want to build a lot of products; we can't do that shipping at a normal pace. We've built the company around small teams \u00e2\u0080\u0093 autonomous, highly-efficient groups of <a href=\"https://posthog.com/founders/cracked-manifesto\"><u>cracked engineers</u></a> who can outship much larger companies because they own their products end-to-end.</p></li><li><p><strong>Time for building:</strong> Nothing gets shipped in a meeting. We're a natively remote company. We default to async communication \u00e2\u0080\u0093 PRs &gt; Issues &gt; Slack. Tuesdays and Thursdays are <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/company/culture#were-on-the-makers-schedule\"><u>meeting-free days</u></a>, and we prioritize heads down building time over perfect coordination. This will be the most productive job you've ever had.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ambition:</strong> We want to solve big problems. We strongly believe that aiming for the best possible upside, and sometimes missing, is better than never trying. We're optimistic about what's possible and our ability to get there.</p></li><li><p><strong>Being weird:</strong> Weird means redesigning an already world-class website for the 5th time. It means shipping <em>literally</em> every product that relates to customer data. It means building an <a href=\"https://posthog.com/deskhog\"><u>objectively unnecessary developer toy</u></a> with dubious shareholder value. Doing weird stuff is a competitive advantage. And it's fun.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Who we're looking for</strong></h2><p>We're hiring for a range of roles here. What you end up working on will depend on your exact skillset and preferences, so choose your own adventure.</p><p>In general we seek Product Engineers who are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Enthusiastic drivers.</strong> We need proactive people that can fully own projects and get them done, and know to get help when needed. This is what being a <a href=\"https://posthog.com/blog/what-is-a-product-engineer\"><u>product engineer</u></a> is all about. \"Are we there yet?\" is the wrong question.</p></li><li><p><strong>Optimistic problem solvers.</strong> Things get hard here sometimes \u00e2\u0080\u0093 whether it's scaling, shipping complex products, handling a stream of support requests, or trying to ship something that touches multiple teams. We need people who won't get disheartened, and will collaborate, iterate, and ship their way out of anything.</p></li><li><p><strong>Grown ups.</strong> We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re an international bunch of weirdos, but one thing unites us: everyone is kind, considerate, and professional towards each other. <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/company/grown-ups\"><u>This isn't about age or experience</u></a>, it's about being low-ego, flexible, and respectful.</p></li><li><p><strong>Genuine builders.</strong> PostHog is full of people who just love building stuff, people who would still be building software even if there wasn't a paycheck at the end. If this sounds like you, we should talk.</p></li></ul><p><br /></p><p>Right now, we are also looking for:</p><ul><li><p><strong>IAM specialist:</strong> You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll design and ship core features like SAML support, new identity providers, and even our own IAM system. Start with internal tooling, then roll them out to customers. Tell us how you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d make these systems so solid that other teams can build on them without hesitation.</p></li></ul><p><br /></p><h2><strong>What you'll be doing</strong></h2><ul><li><p><strong>Owning products and features from beginning to end.</strong> This means originating ideas based on your intuition, talking to users, and understanding our strategy and goals. It means testing MVPs in production with real users. It means <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/product-engineering\"><u>iterating on their feedback</u></a>, owning pricing, and ensuring the ongoing success of your work.</p></li><li><p><strong>Collaborating with design (when necessary).</strong> Product engineers at PostHog are full stack, so we expect you to ship and own the basic UX of your work using <a href=\"https://storybook.posthog.net/\"><u>our design system</u></a><strong>.</strong> From there, it's up to you to decide when to <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/product-design\"><u>collaborate with our design team</u></a> to iterate and polish the experience.</p></li><li><p><strong>Talking to users.</strong> Good product engineers read feedback from users and iterate quickly. Great product engineers have users they're friendly with, talk with them frequently, bounce ideas off them, and iterate with them when they ship new things.</p></li><li><p><strong>Doing support.</strong> Every week, one person in each engineering team is designated the <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/support-hero\"><u>Support hero</u></a>. Their job is to investigate and resolve issues reported by customers for their product. Giving users support from real engineers, and shipping fixes and improvements in real-time, is one of the best ways to spark joy in users. This role will also include some <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/on-call-rotation\"><u>on-call time</u></a>, too.</p></li><li><p><strong>Writing docs.</strong> We have a content team that will collaborate with you on reviewing, polishing, and improving your documentation, but the best person to document a new feature is the person who built it.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Requirements</strong></h2><ul><li><p>Full-stack experience with <a href=\"https://posthog.com/handbook/engineering/stack\"><u>relevant technologies</u></a> \u00e2\u0080\u0093 e.g. Python or similar, React or similar, something to do with big data is a bonus.</p></li><li><p>Experience taking a project from 0 to 1.

Your job is to build the trust, partnerships, and political and institutional foundations required for empirical research into SAI/SRM to proceed responsibly, and in a timely manner.\n\nYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll translate between our scientific and engineering teams, government partners, and external communities and institutions to ensure research proceeds transparently, and in the public interest. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll also shape the environment in which Reflective operates: building coalitions, managing external affairs partners, and coordinating communications and engagement priorities.\n\nThis is a senior, high-judgment role. You should be equally comfortable briefing a government minister, coordinating a community stakeholder workshop, or editing a sensitive press release. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll report to the CEO and work closely with the Heads of Research, Engineering, and Data, as well as external consultants and field partners. You will be expected to work independently at times, making important decisions and representing the organization and research community without much direct guidance.\n\nResponsibilities\n- Identify and create opportunities to cultivate a core network of institutional allies\u00e2\u0080\u0094scientific, policy, and philanthropic\u00e2\u0080\u0094who can publicly and privately support responsible research.\n- Develop processes to track and report on external engagement to Reflective leadership and the wider community.\n- Coordinate with legal, governance, and field partners to map out permitting and policy pathways for a potential controlled, small-scale, outdoor experiment.
