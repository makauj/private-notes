# Object Relational Mappers (ORM)

An ORM is a code library that automates data transfer from a relational database into more commonly used objects used in application code.

ORMs allow developers to write Pytrhon code instaead of SQL to create, read, update and delete data and schemas in their database, allowing a high-level abstraction upon a relational database.
